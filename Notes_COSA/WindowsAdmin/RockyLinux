========================*Rocky Linux*====================

basic cmds and administration

to change hostname:
hostnamectl set-hostname <hostname>

to see IP:
ip a

to assing IP:
nmtui


to view disk information:
fdisk

for eg. fdisk /dev/sdb
n -> p -> 1default -> size(e.g 12GB)

To assing extension:
mkfs.ext4 <disk>
e.g. -> mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb

to mount file:
mount -t auto <diskpath> <fiilepath>
mount -t autp  /dev/sdb   /mnt/file1

to create a directory:
mkdir 

to go to currrent dir:
cd

to view present working directory path:
pwd

to create multiple report 
touch textNo{1..n}.txt

to permanetly mount the disk and file
use :-> vi /etc/fstab
<diskpath> <filepath> <extensiontype> <defaults> 0 0
/dev/sdb  /mnt/dac     auto    defaults 0 0

to unmount the disk:
 -> umount <pathfile>
 e.g umount /dev/sdb1

to remount by giving permission
mount -o remount,ro /ditiss
mount -o remount,rw  /ditiss
readonly and readwrite

tar:- use to compress the file

to check the disk connection
fdisk -l

----------------*Volumes*-----------------
to create physical volumes 
pvcreate <disk> 
pvcreate /dev/sdb1
# can create multiple by addiing more 

to see physical volume 
pvs

to create volume group 
vgcreate <nameofvg> <disk> <file>
vgcreate sunbeam-vg /dev/sdb /mnt/file1

to see vg group
vgs

to extend or add more volume group
vgextend


too create a volume group 
lvcreate -n <name> -L <GB> <volumegroup>

to see logical group
lvs or lvdisplay

to extend or add more volume group 
lvextend -l <GB> <path>
lvextend -L +5G /dev/sunbeam-vg/lv-dbda 

## NEED TO CHECK FIRST
e2fsck -f /dev/sunbeam/lvdbda
e2fsck -f <path of lg vol>


# use  df -khT to see the disk real size

to resize the volume 
resize2fs <path of lv vg > <size>
resize2fs /dev/sunbeam-vg/lvdbda 15G

## to extend its simple 
just use
lvextend -> resize2fs

## to reduce
umount -> e2fsck -> resize2fs -> lvreduce -> Mount

*/ password policy /*

/etc/passwd
Purpose: Stores user account information (username, UID, GID, home directory, shell).

/etc/shadow (more secure)
Purpose: Stores the hashed passwords.

/etc/login.defs

useradd
passwd


chage - cmd use to allow password policy application
-l	Show current aging settings for a user
-M	Set maximum days a password is valid
-m	Set minimum days between password changes
-W	Set number of days of warning before password expires
-I	Set number of inactive days before account is locked
-E	Set account expiration date (YYYY-MM-DD)

chage -m 3 -M 35 -W 10 <user>

/etc/security/pwquality.conf
- use to set the password complexity/parameters
like min length, max length, special and digit char


-g -> primary group
-G -> secondary group

for eg. faculty and ditiss aare those grps in which a student must have permms to ditiss but not to faculty (-g) But a lab assistant  shouldd have ascces to both the groups (-G)
student - A
lab assistant -B

useradd -g ditiss A

useradd -G faculty B

*gpasswd*- used to add/remove user from a group

### WE CAN giver ROOT acces via 2 method
*visudo* - we can give acces to the user

*/full root access/*
username ALL=(ALL)  ALL
*/to specific cmd/*
username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /path/to/Commd

*wheel group*
usermod -G wheel username 

to remove
gpasswd -d username wheel
